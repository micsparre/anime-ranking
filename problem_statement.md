# Problem Statement

You are tasked with designing and implementing an anime recommendation system that allows users to create a list of anime shows they have watched, rank them in comparison to each other, and receive personalized anime recommendations based on their preferences. This system will be developed using the Django framework for the backend, React TypeScript for the frontend, and a PostgreSQL database as the primary data store.

### Design Document

#### Backend (Django):

1. **User Authentication and Profiles:**
    - Implement user registration and login functionality.
    - Create user profiles to store user-specific data.

2. **Anime Database:**
    - Maintain a database of anime titles, including information such as title, genre, synopsis, and release year.

3. **User Anime List:**
    - Create a table to store the user's watched anime titles.
    - Include fields like user_id (foreign key), anime_id (foreign key), and ranking (integer representing the user's preference).

4. **Recommendation Engine:**
    - Develop an algorithm to generate anime recommendations based on user rankings.
    - Use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach to make recommendations.
    - Store recommendation data in a separate table.

5. **API Endpoints:**
    - Create API endpoints for user registration, login, and profile management.
    - Implement endpoints for adding anime to the user's list, ranking anime, and retrieving recommendations.

6. **Data Models:**  
    - Define Django models for `User`, `Anime`, `UserAnimeList`, and `Recommendation`.
    - `User` and `UserProfile` are separated to allow extending the user profile with additional information.
    - `UserAnimeList` contains the user's watched anime titles along with their rankings.
    - `Recommendation` stores the anime titles recommended to each user.

#### Frontend (React TypeScript):

1. **User Interface:**
    - Design a user-friendly interface for user registration, login, profile management, and anime management.
    - Implement a ranking system (e.g., drag-and-drop) for users to rank anime titles.

2. **Anime List Management:**
    - Allow users to search and add anime titles to their watched list.
    - Enable users to edit or remove anime from their list.

3. **Recommendation Display:**
    - Display personalized anime recommendations to the user based on their rankings and watched list.
    - Include anime details and a mechanism for the user to explore and select recommendations.

#### Database (PostgreSQL):

1. **User Table:**
    - Store user-related information (e.g., username, email, password hash).

2. **Anime Table:** 
    - Store anime details (e.g., title, genre, synopsis, release year).

3. **UserAnimeList Table:**
    - Create a join table linking users to anime titles and storing their rankings.

4. **Recommendation Table:**
    - Store the recommended anime titles for each user.

#### Algorithm for Generating Recommendations:

1. **Collaborative Filtering:**
    - Calculate user similarity based on their rankings.
    - Identify users with similar tastes.
    - Recommend anime titles highly rated by similar users but not watched by the target user.

2. **Content-Based Filtering:**
    - Extract features from anime titles (e.g., genre, synopsis).
    - Recommend anime with features similar to the user's highly ranked titles.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. Set up the Django backend with user authentication, database models, and API endpoints.
2. Develop the React TypeScript frontend with user interfaces for registration, login, profile management, and anime management.
3. Implement the anime list management features, including ranking anime titles.
4. Create the recommendation engine using collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms.
5. Develop the recommendation display in the frontend.
6. Test the system thoroughly, including user registration, data management, and recommendation accuracy.
7. Deploy the application on a web server.

By following this design and implementing the components mentioned, you can create an anime recommendation system that allows users to track their watched anime, rank them, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences.
